# Muzz Code Test Solution

This is my solution to the Muzz Frontend Engineering Test

## Process / Decisions

I will be documenting my process and decisions as I work through this test. Hopefully this should explain my approach to the problem. I'm going to focus on making improvements to the codebase before starting on any of the feature and testing work.

### 1. Getting the site running and building

I didn't have much trouble getting the site running in dev mode, although there seemed to be some issues with the backend code which were preventing me from running it out of the box. It was only a couple of typescript issues which needed resolving though.

There were also a couple of small linting issues preventing the site from building which I resolved as well.

### 2. Basic performance analysis

Before diving into the code I was keen to check a few things first.

- Play around with the React DevTools profiler to see whether there are any rendering performance issues
- Run a lighthouse test
- Run a bundle analysis

As expected, given the small size of the app, there were no glaring issues. In a real life scenario with a bigger app this would definitely be my first move though. I did notice when using the profiler that page interactions where triggering uneccessary full page rerenders.

### 3. Familiarise with the codebase

Before making any changes I spent some time familiarising with the codebase and identifying areas where the structure could be improved and where the code could made more modular and scalable. Key areas I picked up on were as follows.

- No code formatting library in use
- No commit hooks
- Relative imports
- Shared components all in single folder
- "Pages" and "Features" co-located. Confusing features boundaries and logic.
- Using a store to manage page/route state.
- Store actions not seperated from state.
- No use of middleware or persistence in the stores.
- Query client being created _within_ the render resulting in it being recreated on every render.
- Lots of arbitrary tailwind values in place (especially for colors) instead of tailwind config extension.
- Conditional tailwind classes being managed with ternaries.
- All page interactions seem to result in full page rerender
- "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "off" ðŸ˜‚ + various type safety issues.
